# Changelog

- Build step copies `dist/js` into `www/missing-js` so components in pages like `40-aria.md` can function when deployed to Netlify.
- Fixed `<select>` elements being taller than `<input>` elements in inline contexts.
- Fixed a bug in the `hotkey` function where modifier keys were not being parsed.
- Reduced bloat and fixed bugs by removing IE11 transcompilation.
- Fixed some bugs in the documentation website.
- Fixed the build process to work around a Deno bug.
